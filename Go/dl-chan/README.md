# DL chan

Downloads all images from a specified 4chan board.

This was mostly made to get a bit of a grip on Golang, as the following have to be done:

* Access a JSON API
* Retrieve some values
* Download images
* Save those to the filesystem

As well as some stuff like checking if a file exists etc.

TODO:
* Allow output location and board to be specified through the command line
